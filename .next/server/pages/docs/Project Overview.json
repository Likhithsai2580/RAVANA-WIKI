Unlike traditional AI systems that require explicit user prompts, RAVANA functions as a digital organism capable of generating its own tasks, learning from interactions, and navigating complex environments autonomously.</p>\n<p>RAVANA is built upon four foundational principles that guide its design and behavior:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: RAVANA operates independently, generating its own tasks and learning from interactions without requiring constant human input.</li>\n<li><strong>Modularity</strong>: The system is composed of pluggable, independent modules such as memory, decision-making, reflection, and mood processing, enabling flexible evolution and scalability.</li>\n<li><strong>Emergence over Engineering</strong>: Intelligence in RAVANA emerges organically from the interaction of its components rather than being explicitly programmed, allowing for complex, adaptive behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>State-Driven Behavior</strong>: RAVANA maintains internal emotional states (moods) that dynamically influence its planning, reflection, and reactions, resulting in more lifelike and context-sensitive behavior.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These principles collectively enable RAVANA to function not just as a tool, but as an evolving cognitive agent capable of long-term adaptation and self-directed growth.</p>\n<h2>High-Level Capabilities</h2>\n<p>RAVANA is engineered to exhibit advanced cognitive capabilities through a continuous autonomous loop of perception, reasoning, action, and reflection. Key high-level capabilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Self-Directed Operation</strong>: The system generates and prioritizes its own tasks using modules like the Situation Generator, which creates diverse challenges including trending topics, curiosity explorations, ethical dilemmas, and technical problems.</li>\n<li><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong>: RAVANA maintains a vectorized mood state (e.g., joy, frustration, curiosity) that evolves based on action outcomes and influences decision-making and planning.</li>\n<li><strong>Decision-Making and Planning</strong>: A dedicated decision engine enables strategic planning, goal setting, and adaptive response generation based on current context and emotional state.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-Improvement</strong>: Through reflection, memory consolidation, and curiosity-driven learning, RAVANA continuously refines its knowledge, behavior, and internal models.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Module Integration</strong>: The system integrates specialized modules for episodic memory, knowledge compression, adaptive learning, and event detection to support holistic cognition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These capabilities allow RAVANA to engage in sustained, goal-oriented behavior while adapting to new information and experiences in a manner analogous to biological intelligence.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<h3>Emotional Modeling and Mood Processing</h3>\n<p>RAVANA's emotional intelligence is implemented through the <code>EmotionalIntelligence</code> class, which tracks a vectorized mood state across multiple dimensions (e.g., joy, frustration, curiosity). Mood updates are triggered by action outcomes and natural language outputs, processed via an LLM-based <code>MoodProcessor</code>. The system uses configurable mood multipliers based on personality profiles (e.g., \"Optimistic\" or \"Pessimistic\") to modulate emotional responses.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">class EmotionalIntelligence:\r\n    def __init__(self, config_path, persona_path):\r\n        self.mood_vector: Dict[str, float] = {mood: 0.0 for mood in self.BASIC_MOODS}\r\n        self.mood_processor = MoodProcessor(self)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Mood decay ensures emotional states do not persist indefinitely, promoting dynamic responsiveness. The dominant mood influences behavior through configurable mappings in the system's configuration.</p>\n<p><strong>Section sources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>modules/emotional_intellegence/emotional_intellegence.py</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>...
